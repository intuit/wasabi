## Get Started

Installing Wasabi is straightforward. The following steps will install the needed tools, build and run a
complete stack noting that at this time only OSX is supported.

#### Bootstrap Your Environment

```bash
% /usr/bin/ruby \
  -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
% brew install git
% git clone https://github.com/intuit/wasabi.git
% cd wasabi
% ./bin/wasabi.sh bootstrap
```

**Note**: if you have installed docker-native set the environment variable _'WASABI_OS'_

```bash
% export WASABI_OS=native
``

Installed tools include: [homebrew 0.9](http://brew.sh), [git 2](https://git-scm.com),
[maven 3](https://maven.apache.org), [java 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html),
[docker 1.12](https://docker.com), [node 6](https://nodejs.org/en) and [python 2.7](https://www.python.org).

Similar tooling will work for Linux and Windows alike. Contribute a patch :)

#### Start Wasabi

Now that we have the necessary tools in place let's move on to build and start Wasabi followed by issuing a _ping_
command to verify the build:

```bash
% ./bin/wasabi.sh --build true start
...
wasabi is operational:

  ui: % open http://192.168.99.100:8080     note: sign in as admin/admin
  api: % curl -i http://192.168.99.100:8080/api/v1/ping
  debug: attach debuger to 192.168.99.100:8180

% curl -i http://$(docker-machine ip wasabi):8080/api/v1/ping
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 25 May 2016 00:25:47 GMT
...

Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
  "componentHealths":[
    {
      "componentName":"Experiments Cassandra",
      "healthy":true
    },
    {
      "componentName":"MySql","healthy":true
    }
  ],
  "wasabiVersion":"wasabi-api-20151215171929-SNAPSHOT-development"
}
```

Congratulations! You are the proud owner of a newly minted and personalized full stack Wasabi instance :)

Ok, enough celebration ... let's get back to business.

#### Troubleshooting

* While starting Wasabi, if you run into errors such as this, run this command in
your terminal and re-run ./bin/wasabi.sh start:

> Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?

```bash
% eval $(docker-machine env wasabi)
```

#### Call Wasabi

These are the 3 common API's that you'd use to instrument your client application with Wasabi.

Let's assume that you've created and started an experiment 'BuyButton' in 'Demo_App' application with:

* 'BucketA': green button, control bucket
* 'BucketB': orange button bucket

You can assign a user with a unique ID (e.g. 'userID1') to the experiment by calling this API Request:

> Assign a user to experiment and bucket:

```bash
% curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    http://192.168.99.100:8080/api/v1/assignments/applications/Demo_App/experiments/BuyButton/users/userID1

{  
   "cache":true,
   "payload":"green",
   "assignment":"BucketA",
   "context":"PROD",
   "status":"NEW_ASSIGNMENT"
}
```

Now the 'userID1' user is assigned into the 'BucketA' bucket. Let's record an impression of their experience 
with this API Request:

> Record an impression:

```bash
% curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"events\":[{\"name\":\"IMPRESSION\"}]}" \
    http://192.168.99.100:8080/api/v1/events/applications/Demo_App/experiments/BuyButton/users/userID1
```

If the 'userID1' user does an action, such as clicking the buy button, you'd record it with this API Request: 

> Record an action:

```bash
% curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"events\":[{\"name\":\"BuyClicked\"}]}" \
    http://192.168.99.100:8080/api/v1/events/applications/Demo_App/experiments/BuyButton/users/userID1
```

#### Explore Various Resources

The following developer resources are available:

> API: Swagger API playground

```bash
% ./bin/wasabi.sh resource:api
```
  
> Javadoc

```bash
% ./bin/wasabi.sh resource:doc
```
  
> Wasabi UI

```bash
% ./bin/wasabi.sh resource:ui
```

> Cassandra: cqlsh shell

```bash
% ./bin/wasabi.sh resource:cassandra
```

> MySQL: mysql shell

```bash
% ./bin/wasabi.sh resource:mysql
```

> Java Debugger: Remote attach configuration

```bash
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8180
```


#### Stop Wasabi

Alas, all good things must come to an end. Let's clean things up a bit stop the newly created Wasabi stack:

At this point in time we now have all the requisite tools installed and as such subsequent invocations of Wasabi will
start up much more quickly. Additionally there is no further need to include the _-b true_ or _--build true_ option.

```bash
% ./bin/wasabi.sh stop
```

#### Get Familiar with wasabi.sh

Further, there are a number of additional wasabi.sh options available you should become familiar with:

```bash
% ./bin/wasabi.sh --help
  
  usage: wasabi.sh [options] [commands]
  
  options:
    -b | --build [ true | false ]          : build; default: false
    -e | --endpoint [ host:port ]          : api endpoint; default: localhost:8080
    -v | --verify [ true | false ]         : verify installation configuration; default: false
    -s | --sleep [ sleep-time ]            : sleep/wait time in seconds; default: 30
    -h | --help                            : help message
  
  commands:
    bootstrap                              : install dependencies
    start[:cassandra,mysql,wasabi]         : start all, cassandra, mysql, wasabi
    test                                   : test wasabi
    stop[:wasabi,cassandra,mysql]          : stop all, wasabi, cassandra, mysql
    resource[:ui,api,doc,cassandra,mysql]  : open resource api, javadoc, cassandra, mysql
    status                                 : display resource status
    remove[:wasabi,cassandra,mysql]        : remove all, wasabi, cassandra, mysql
    package                                : build deployable packages
    release[:start,finish]                 : promote release
```

## Develop

Let's turn it up to 11. To facilitate developing Wasabi contributions you can easily build and run from source and readily connect to the a fore mentioned infrastructure:

#### Build and Run Wasabi Server

```bash
% mvn package
% ./bin/wasabi.sh start:cassandra,mysql
% dmip=$(docker-machine ip wasabi)
% (cd modules/main/target; \
    WASABI_CONFIGURATION="-DnodeHosts=${dmip} -Ddatabase.url.host=${dmip}" ./wasabi-main-*-SNAPSHOT-development/bin/run) &
% curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ping
...
```

The runtime logs can be accessed executing the following command in a another shell:

> Viewing runtime logs:

```bash
% tail -f modules/main/target/wasabi-main-*-SNAPSHOT-development/logs/wasabi-main-*-SNAPSHOT-development.log
```

#### Build and Run Wasabi UI

```bash
% cd modules/ui
% grunt build
```

> Edit Gruntfile.js with the following change to the apiHostBaseUrlValue value, since you would be running the
Wasabi server on localhost.

```javascript
development: {
  constants: {
    supportEmail: 'you@example.com',
    apiHostBaseUrlValue: 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1'
  }
}
```

```bash
% grunt serve
```

#### Stop Wasabi

```bash
% ./bin/wasabi.sh stop
```

Now while that was fun, in all likelihood you will be using an IDE to develop Wasabi features. In doing so you need only
add the aforementioned configuration information to your Wasabi JVM runtime prior to startup:

> Wasabi runtime configuration:

```bash
-DnodeHosts=$(docker-machine ip wasabi) -Ddatabase.url.host=$(docker-machine ip wasabi)
```

Awesome! You are well on your way at this point in time.

#### Run Integration Tests

Code changes can readily be verified by running the growing collection of included integration tests:

```bash
% ./bin/wasabi.sh start test stop
```

## Package and Deploy at Scale

Wasabi can readily be packaged as installable *rpm* or *deb* distributions and deployed at scale as follows:

```bash
% ./bin/wasabi.sh package
% find ./modules -type f \( -name "*.rpm" -or -name "*.deb" \)
```

Note: [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) is a runtime dependency

## Integrate

Wasabi is readily embeddable via the following *maven* dependency GAV family:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.intuit.wasabi</groupId>
    <artifactId>wasabi</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.20160627213750<build_timestamp></version>
</dependency>
```
